	<h1>Stellar</h1>
<b>Stellar</b> is an open-source program inspired in 'Game Maker' for <b>Pygame/Python</b> development.
<br>
<br>	    The goal is to have a program to design your own games using easy-to-learn drag-and-drop actions and different easy tools for begginers.
<br>    When you become more experienced, you will have the possibility of writing and editing your game with the full flexibility given by <b>Python/Pygame</b>.
<br>
<br>	    This is an incomplete version. Currently, it has almost nothing, but I would love to be helped by anyone interested in the project.
<br>
<br>    You are free to distribute the games you create with <b>Stellar</b> in any way you like. You can even sell them.
<br>     This of course assumes that the sprites, images, and sounds you use can be distributed or sold as well.
